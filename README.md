Prompt
One way to describe the elements of a unity project and its relationships is to think of the project as an animated attraction at a theme park. Scenes represent the different attractions at a theme park. 
Each attraction has its own visuals and designs that create memorable experiences, similar to moving objects in a level to make a unique level. Game objects are represented as the individual pieces 
within the attraction. Each individual character and prop has its own design and function, serving different purposes to emphasize the attraction itself, such as having different weapons or obstacles 
in a level. Components are the internal mechanisms of each set piece. The internals of an animatronic can make a character move or an object float, bringing vitality to the different set pieces, 
like the code of the game that gives the objects gameplay mechanics. All the elements of an attraction are vital to designing an  effective experience. Internal mechanisms need to make the set piece 
move in a way that brings life and emphasis to the attraction as a whole in order to create a noteworthy experience

-Big idea = Animated attraction at a theme park
-componets = internals that make the robots move
-game objects = different set pieces within the attractoin, some move while others are stationary
-scenes = The entire attraction together for people to watch
